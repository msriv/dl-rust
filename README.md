### DL in Rust

Following the @sentdex playlist for building NN from scratch. The playlist is in python. 

Building it in rust because - 
1. Wanted to learn rust and NN and this seemed like a perfect intersection. 
2. Seems like Rust might be a good low level language to implement something like a NN because it needs good performance. 

* These are just high level thoughts at the moment. As I go deeper into the series and start benchmarking the performance against python, I'll have a better understanding of why Rust might or might not be better for this exercise.
